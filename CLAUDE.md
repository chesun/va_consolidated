# CLAUDE.MD -- Applied Microeconomics Research with Claude Code

<!-- HOW TO USE: Replace [BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS] with your project info.
     Customize for your analysis language, LaTeX engine, and identification strategy.
     Keep this file under ~150 lines — Claude loads it every session.
     Based on clo-author (Hugo Sant'Anna) + infrastructure from Pedro Sant'Anna. -->

## Core Principles

- **Plan first** -- enter plan mode before non-trivial tasks; save plans to `quality_reports/plans/`
- **Verify after** -- compile and confirm output at the end of every task
- **Single source of truth** -- Paper `main.tex` is authoritative; talks and supplements derive from it
- **Quality gates** -- weighted aggregate score; nothing ships below 80/100; see `quality.md`
- **Worker-critic pairs** -- every creator has a paired critic; critics never edit files
- **Primary source first** -- before citing a paper in a load-bearing artifact, read the PDF and produce reading notes in `master_supporting_docs/literature/reading_notes/`; hooks block edits otherwise (see `primary-source-first.md`)
- **Decisions are ADRs** -- substantive design, identification, or specification decisions live in `decisions/NNNN_slug.md`; analysis docs hold reasoning, ADRs hold the record (see `decision-log.md`)
- **Track TODOs** -- project root `TODO.md` tracks open work (Active / Up Next / Waiting / Backlog / Done); update after completing any task (see `todo-tracking.md`)
- **[LEARN] tags** -- when corrected, save `[LEARN:category] wrong → right` to MEMORY.md

## Getting Started

1. Fill in the `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]` in this file
2. Run `/discover interview [topic]` to build your research specification
3. Or run `/new-project [topic]` for the full orchestrated pipeline

## Quality Thresholds

| Score | Gate | Applies To |
|-------|------|------------|
| 80 | Commit | Weighted aggregate (blocking) |
| 90 | PR | Weighted aggregate (blocking) |
| 95 | Submission | Aggregate + all components >= 80 |
| -- | Advisory | Talks (reported, non-blocking) |

See `quality.md` for weighted aggregation formula.
